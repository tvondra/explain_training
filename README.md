Explain plans training
======================

This repository contains training materials I use when teaching how to
read execution plans in PostgreSQL (and to some extent in general).
The materials are a WIP and currently available in Czech language only.

It's done in the form of (.odp) LibreOffice Impress - basic slides with
additional notes and comments in the speakers notes. The repository
contains two PDF files - one with slides only (suitable for a beamer),
the other one with slides and speaker notes (suitable for printing).
